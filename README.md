# tdd-assessment-incubyte
This is public repository where I have pushed the code for TDD assessment. 

Steps That i follow for the code and test cases:- 

1. Add test and implementation for empty string

2. Handle single number input

3. Handle two comma-separated numbers

4. Support multiple numbers

5. Support newline as separator

6. Support custom delimiter

7. Raise exception for negative numbers

Note:- added test cases first then written code for the functionality also modified the method in the StringCalculator class for every case.

added comments in code for every commit and steps.
